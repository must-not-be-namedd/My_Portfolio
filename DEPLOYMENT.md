[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### vercel.json
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]

- Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run check`

```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# macOS/Linux
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
```

```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
